Arthem Boilerplate
==================

Hey there!
So this little thing is meant to be out very own boilerplate to jump start projects.
As it lives, it should be updated to follow our accepted best practices, and include all the tools we regularly use, and should name our current stack. So, without further ado...

## Our Stack ##

### CSS

* SCSS
* [sanitize.css](https://github.com/jonathantneal/sanitize.css), Jonathan Neal, CC0 1.0 Universal License
* [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), (C) 2012-2016 Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal, [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
* Autoprefixer

### JS

* JS      - JQuery case dependent
* GSAP    - Web animation
* lodash  - Case Dependent

### HTML

* Emmet
* modernizr

### Managers

* NPM


## Formatting ##
----------------------------------------------------------------

Comment magic numbers, sections within sections.
A middle way between BEM and SMACSS is best. See https://www.sitepoint.com/bem-smacss-advice-from-developers/

Follow {} conventions in appropriate language. Semantic HTML5 where possible.
